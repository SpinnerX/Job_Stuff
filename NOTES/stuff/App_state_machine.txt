Question:  This state machine ( https://i.imgur.com/5srBQsG.png ) reads input character by character and accepts strings if it is in state S6. Its goal is to accept a string if it contains a certain substring. What strings will it accept? Will it always achieve its goal? If not, how would you improve it? * 

Answer 
- The substrings that will be accepted if those substrings contain the following characters in this order, N, I, N, J, A. If the substring does not contain these characters then the current state would go back into it's initial state. How we could improve this state machine is by is that the current showing state machine iterates thhrough different states in linear. An improved idea on this state machine is by having a hash table, where we can check if the substring contains any characters in that data structure. Allowing us to not iteratively go through the entire state and check if these chharacters are contained within the substring. As based on the diagram it would an O(N) time complexity. Rather the hash table could do this operation in O(1).
